                   <p>One of the key features of React Native is its versatility. This library can be used on server and mobile platforms. Another important feature of the library is the method of declarative programming that shortens the code and makes it understandable. With the help of React, the developer describes how the components of the interface look in different states. The framework is the best option for you, if your task is to develop Single-Page Applications (SPA) or enterprise-grade applications for your business. By the way, the giants PayPal and Airbnb were developed using React!
